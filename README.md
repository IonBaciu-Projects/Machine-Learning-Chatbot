# Cybersecurity ML Chatbot  

An interactive machine learning chatbot that answers common cybersecurity questions such as SQL, Linux, Malware, Programming Languages, SIEM tools, and more.  
It uses scikit learn for query classification and responds with security knowledge.  

> **Note:** This project is still in progress. It may make mistakes or misclassify some inputs. Updates will come soon.  

## Features  
- Pretrained ML model (`model.pkl`) for classifying questions  
- Context-aware conversations (e.g., malware types, Linux commands)  
- Chat logs saved in `chat_log.txt`  
- Expandable training data (`data.py`) and responses dictionary
